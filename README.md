<!-- PROJECTS -->
## Projects

### Dashboard
- [Dashboard](https://github.com/diegotorreslopez81/HealthID/tree/main/packages/dashboard)
- HealthID Dashboard is coded in React is designed to provide a content log to block and monetize, as well as metrics for your blocked content. 

### Progressive Web App (HealthID Wallet)
- [PWA](https://github.com/HealthID/tree/main/packages/smartwallet-pwa)
- HealthID wallet is a Progressive Web App fully encoded in React. HealthID Wallet is designed to provide verifiable credential issuing and sharing and QR code scanner. 

### API
- [API](https://github.com/diegotorreslopez81/HealthID/tree/main/packages/api)
- HealthID API is coded in NodeJS and Zenroom, designed to run microservices required by the Dashboard and the progressive web app. 

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [git](https://git-scm.com/) v2.13 or greater
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) `12 || 14 || 15 || 16`
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v6 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/) or [mac/linux](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24306398/how-to-add-mongo-commands-to-path-on-mac-osx/24322978#24322978).

### Setup

> If you want to commit and push your work as you go, you'll want to
> [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
> first and then clone your fork rather than this repo directly.
After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you
should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```
git clone https://github.com/diegotorreslopez81/HealthID.git
```

<!-- 
If you want to run HealthID, you should wake up the API, then run the Dashboard, install Publisher JS in the site you want to sell content and finally use the PWA to generate credentials and payments.


Consult the different project documentation to use:

- [Dashboard](./packages/dashboard/README.md)
- [Progressive web app](./packages/smartwallet-pwa/README.md)
- [API](./packages/api/README.md)
- [Publisher JS](./packages/publisherjs/README.md)
